Transport models and simulation form the basis for much of the evidence base to inform decision-making on vast spans of infrastructure planning, management as well as real-time optimization. The research goals of the Chair span the range of the aforementioned challenges:

- **Scientific Representation:** Research new methodologies to enhance the mathematical foundation for transport modelling aross the spectrum of microscopic, macroscopic and mesoscopic scales. This includes traveller behaviour in the context of real-time information and unfamiliar/disrupted conditions.

- **Computational Performance:** Develop new tools that enable larger-scale and automated analysis through the usage of emerging techniques spanning machine learning, AI, Big Data and Digital Twins.

- **Interdisciplinary Scope:** Explore inter-domain applications for transport modelling, including ethics-based metrics (including sustainability & equity), energy, health, and automation.
